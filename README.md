Kittens Chat

This here's my attempt to write a neat-o node.js-based chat.

It's (loosely) based on the code found [here](http://martinsikora.com/nodejs-and-websocket-simple-chat-tutorial) but that'll change as I fix things.

It currently works...ish.  Lots of fixes.  This should by no means be considered production code.
